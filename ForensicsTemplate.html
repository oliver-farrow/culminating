    <h1>What I Learned for Forensics Templates</h1>
    <br />
    <strong>Computer Forensic Analysis is Obtaining, Analyzing and Preserving Info on a Computer.</strong>
    <br />
    <p>In order to be an efficient Forensic Analyst you must:</p>
    <p>Define the Scope and Objective (What needs to get done?)</p>
    <p>Identify and Preserve the Evidence (Find a file, figure out file type, find user,etc.)</p>
    <p>Analyze Evidence (Is it encrypted?)</p>
    <p>Document and Present Findings (Show Answer)</p>

    <h1>The Proof</h1>
    <p>I went to Open-Source practice images and solved an example question. With each specific quesiton, you usually learn a specific action as a result of solving it. During my learning, I discovered hidden files and accessing properties to a network shares.</p>
    <p>Here are images of the questions and proof of their answering. The first is proof of points earned. The second is a result of knowing how to access hidden files. The third and fourth are a result of knowing the properties of all network shares. More specifically "PLANPARI$"</p>
