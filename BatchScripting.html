    <h1>What I learned for Batch Scripting</h1>
    <hr/>
    <strong>I am a script rookie to start I learned the general template of a script, including:</strong>
    <p>Using @echo off to reduce clutter</p>
    <p>Using "color (insert two numbers between 0-9)" to change the scripts color</p>
    <p>Using pause to force the user to input a character before closing the script</p>
    <p>How to comment either in the terminal or in the code with "REM" or "echo"</p>
    <strong>As I wrote my scripts I was able to change all Account Lockout Policies, almost all password policies, and some audit policies</strong>
    <p> The script I used acted as such, its code is underneath the image.</p>
